# Aurora Of Ivalice (AOI)

Aurora Of Ivalice (AOI) is a dynamic sunset system mod that gradually alters the visual post-processing of the game over time, giving maps a sunset effect.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Sunset System**: Over a span of 20 minutes, the mod gradually applies post-processing changes, transitioning the map visuals to a sunset effect.
- **Time Persistence**: The time progression is stored and carried across map transitions, ensuring the presets are applied based on the current time.
- **Presets for Various Maps**: Includes well-tuned presets for most open-world maps, tailored for a visually pleasing experience.

## FAQs

### Which maps are included?
- All open-world maps are included, except for the Trial Mode.

### Have all maps been tested?
- Not completely, but the majority have been tested.

### What does "dynamic" mean?
- The mod applies gradual post-processing adjustments over a 20-minute interval, creating a dynamic transition to a sunset effect.

### Is the cycle reset when changing maps?
- No, the time progression is stored, and presets are applied based on the current in-game time.

### Can the visuals be made darker?
- Yes, but fine-tuning each map is time-intensive. The included presets are optimized to look visually pleasing; making them darker might degrade the experience.

### Why doesn't it become fully night?
- Achieving a true night effect would require loading textures from other maps, which is complex and incompatible with gradual texture transitions.

### Is it compatible with all mods?
- Compatibility with all mods isn't guaranteed. However, it works well with most of Xeavin's mods.

### What are the future plans?
- Improved refinement of current presets.
- Additional presets for specific regions (sets of maps).
- Exposing the time (day, evening, night) for use in other mods, such as stronger monsters at night.
- Exploring texture or global lighting adjustments to enhance visuals further.

### Have you ever worked with .lua or modding games before?
- No, this is my first time both modding games and using the Lua language.

## Known Issues

- The sunset effect is only applied after transitioning between maps.
- Teleportation between maps may cause maps to appear darker than intended. This is a known issue without an easy fix currently.
